## 🔍 Research: Multi-Objective Optimization of a Hybrid Renewable Energy System
This repository presents the full simulation and optimization of a standalone Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES) designed to supply power to a rural community in Udhruh, southern Jordan.

Technologies: Python • NSGA-II • PVLib • NumPy • Pandas

## 📈 Objectives
🔧 Design optimization of the HRES components: PV, Wind, Battery, and Diesel Generator (DG)

## ⚙️ Optimization Approach
Multi-objective algorithm: NSGA-II

EMS: Greedy logic (PV → Wind → Battery → DG → Load Shedding)
