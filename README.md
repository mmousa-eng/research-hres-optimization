## 🔍 Research: Multi-Objective Optimization of a Hybrid Renewable Energy System
This repository presents the full simulation and optimization of a standalone Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES) designed to supply power to a rural community in Udhruh, southern Jordan.

Technologies: Python • NSGA-II • PVLib • NumPy • Pandas

## 📈 Objectives
🔧 Design optimization of HRES components: PV, Wind, Battery, and Diesel Generator (DG)

⚙️ Energy management using a greedy dispatch logic prioritizing renewable sources

♻️ Minimize:

Capital and maintenance cost (CAPEX)

Operating cost (OPEX) including fuel and battery degradation

CO₂ emissions from diesel generators
